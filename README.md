## About Me

Hi there! I'm Zeynab, and I'm really into software engineering and learning about new things in tech.

My work is all about creating systems that can grow and learning as much as I can about software development. I love solving problems because each one helps me learn something new and become better at what I do.

When I'm not working on my computer, I like to stay updated on tech trends, read interesting books, or travel to new places. I also care a lot about helping out in my community and using technology to do good things.

I love being in nature—it makes me happy. Whether it’s hiking in the forest, seeing beautiful flowers, or enjoying the sun, nature is my favorite place to be. In my spare time, I enjoy watching TV shows, taking care of my indoor plants, or working out at the gym. also I am a cat mom now, I love spending time with my two kittens Namak and Felfel. 🐈‍⬛❤️
